# CustomerService

This repo contains individual services which are being developed as a part of the EY Techathon 5.0.

The problem statement was for BPOs/BPMs and their high customer supports calls and queries which they face.

This solution aims to provide a better method for support employees to focus on customers/clients with actually complex or important queries and allow the more mundane queries to be handled by AI chatbots and agents.
